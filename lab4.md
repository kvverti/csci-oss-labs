Why is it important to choose a license?  
Choosing a license allows one to give freedoms to users of the software. A license defines what users may do with the software, including in what circumstances the software may be used, modified, or distributed.

Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?  
The lack of a license implies that the software is "all rights reserved" and it is not legally safe to use the software for any purpose.

### Open System Model  
In general, I agree. Having open source software and open processes allows for faster development and a greater sense of agency for the user base.

### .NET Core Open Source  
.NET Core uses the MIT license. This is probably because the .NET Core project was started to bridge the gap between .NET for Windows and cross-platform .NET implementations. The MIT license would be the most backward-compatible (behavior-wise) with previous licenses because there are almost no restrictions on what can be done with the source after distribution. Using a permissive license may also attract more contributors than, for example, a copyleft license.

### License Comparison
The Apache license is a perissive license, while the GPL and LGPL are copyleft. The LGPL does not require linked binaries to be released under the same license, while GPL does not have this exception. The Apache license would be best for business users, since it allows proprietary modifications. LGPL would be more relaxive for users because it allows isolation of the copyleft propagation. Copyleft licenses like GPL and LGPL are of course the best for the common good, since they require the open contribution cycle.
